# Patch Extraction
 [CLAM](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CLAM/blob/master/create_patches_fp.py) extracts .h5 coordinates of each patch.

Since this work  requires jpg, this [script](https://github.com/aimagelab/mil4wsi/blob/main/0-extract_patches/convert_h5_to_jpg.py) converts the coordinates into images.

Use this script inside the [CLAM](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CLAM) repository
