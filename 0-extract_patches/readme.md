# Patch Extraction
 [CLAM](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CLAM/blob/master/create_patches_fp.py) extracts .h5 coordinates of each patch.

Since this work  requires jpg, this script converts the coordinates into images.

Use this script inside the [CLAM](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CLAM) repository
